### [DEMO](http://kjantzer.github.io/backbone-token-editor/)

### Overview

A basic text editor with tokens that are used via auto-complete. Tokens cannot be modified by the keyboard but appear as "objects" within the text box.

The editor is designed to be used completely with the keyboard only, thus, the auto-complete results cannot be selected with the mouse.

Instead, use the **up and down arrows** to choose, then press *enter* to select.
